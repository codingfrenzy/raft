Project goals:

Executor - change the design to use executor instead of having 4 threads running all the time.
java8 lambda (implement the single method in an interface using the shorthand)


--------------

Implementation quick to-dos:

Log helper
    - command exist?
        - what DS to use? fast insert and search and order
    current term/index
Log simultar for testing/workshop
    - election validation
    - exist
    - overwrite
Candidate RV
Follower validate RV
start termTimeout timer thread in starter for Candidate


logger helper - make it one instance per jvm



// in manager.update() method=
    get new value
    if exists, replace with new value
        erase everything later



term timer and state changer
promote candidate
demote leader upon term completion (will need a request queue to store backlog if no leader is present; can be done in the load balancer wchich redirects queries to leader)
